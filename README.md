Hey, this was kinda fun... wish I had time to jazz it up with some more stuff.

Anyway, you can access the application by following the create-react-app setup steps and then running the command 'npm start'.

Not sure if it matters to you but I had to also handle cors locally by modifying the server files. Those modified files are also included in the './servermodifications' folder.
